# Hi, I'm
![GitHub Logo](/header2.png)
<hr>

I make **hard- and software**.

Experienced in Go, Python, TS/JS and a bit of C and Java. 

I like to learn stuff so I am probably sidequesting rn. 

Main project: [rxdb](https://github.com/vividsystem/rxdb) (a member database website to manage the members of exchange clubs) <br/>
Sidequests: 
* [painter-hat](https://github.com/vividsystem/painter-hat) (an add-on pcb for Raspberry Pis (also works standalone) that supports USB-C PD up to 100W and can use 2 standard step-sticks to controll 2 stepper motors), and a few secret ones :)
* [pos-todo](https://github.com/vividsystem/pos-todo) (pos-todo makes it possible to use old EPSON receipt printers for literally anything. right now there are a slackbot and a website as frontends. As the backend is using mqtt you can easily use it with IoT solutions)
